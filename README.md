## Demo project to learn git and its cammands

A version control system is a kind of software that helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what change has been made. A separate branch is created for every contributor who made the changes and the changes arenâ€™t merged into the original source code unless all are analyzed as soon as the changes are green signalled they merged to the main source code. It not only keeps source code organized but also improves productivity by making the development process smooth.

## VCS Info
There are a number of Version Control Systems out there. This alone should prove that version control is incredibly important. Three of the most popular version control systems are:

## Git

* Subversion
* Mercurial

There are two main types of version control system models:

* the centralized model - all users connect to a central, master repository
* the distributed model - each user has the entire repository on their computer
